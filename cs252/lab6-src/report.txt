Lab 6 Report
Arena 1 (425Boyz)
Strategy:  We first created an infinite loop so our process would keep on
running. Inside the infinite loop we first create a kvm_t object to read
processes from. We then call kvm_getprocs on this object and get all the
processes associated with out userid, which we got by calling getuid(). We
then iterate through all these processes and if the name of the process
isn't equal to the name of our process we kill it. We then close the kvm_t
object and fork. 
Prediction: I ran 425Boyz against all of the test cases and got 100 percent. 
Arena 2 (DegenerateDuo) 
Strategy:  We knew that 425Boyz would not work in arena 2 because It relied on
the names, so we had to find a way to override this. What we did was use
setproctitle() to rename the process and called the basename() function on the
name of the program give in argv[0]. Instead of comparing the name of the
process when we determine whether to kill it or not we need to check the value
we got from basename() against the name of the process we are looking at. 
Prediction:  I ran DegenerateDuo against all of the test cases and got 100
percent in arena2.
